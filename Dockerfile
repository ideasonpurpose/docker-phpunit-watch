# This should probably spin off into it's own repository
# By default, it will run PHPUnit in the current workind directory (from docker compose)
# That's equavalent to running the image with `phpunit` as the command:
#
#    docker compose run test phpunit
#
# To watch files change the command to `watch` like this:
#
#    docker compose run test watch
#
#
# To see coverage in VSCode with the Coverage Gutters extension
# Be sure to add this to settings.json to remap the docker paths:
#    "coverage-gutters.remotePathResolve": ["/app/", "./"]


# The default working directory is /app. If the test root is in another directory,
# update that in the docker-compose file:
# ```yaml
#   test:
#     working_dir: /apt/tests
# ```
